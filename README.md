# spam-classification-KNN-MLP-
The code implements two machine learning models for spam classification: k-nearest neighbours
(kNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). The code first loads the spam data from a CSV file and
normalises the features. Then, it splits the data into training and test sets. The kNN model is trained
on the training set and the MLP model is trained on the training set. Finally, the models are
evaluated on the test set and the results are printed.
